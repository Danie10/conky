# GadgeteerZA Conky

Conky is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays any kind of information on your desktop. It's official project is at https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky.

This project shares the Conky code I'm using for my computer's performance stats on the desktop. The screenshot below shows the current setup I have, and I shareda  video about my initial install at https://youtu.be/ItZAMXO-FIA, which shows the temperature color automatically changing between red and green depending on whether the temperature value is above or below a certain threshold. In this case I set it to 55 just for illustrative purposes, but you could make that 75 or any other value.

The shared file is normally found on Linux at ~/.config/conky/conky.conf.
